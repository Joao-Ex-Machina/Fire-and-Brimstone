# Fire-and-Brimstone
Fire and Brimstone is a arcade-type shooter I co-created in the Unity Engine. Final project for AIB (sy 19/20).

The Final Scripts of the game are on the FinalScripts directory, this because I accidentaly uploaded initially the pre-alpha versions of the scripts,
I will keep them here for future learning and analysis
